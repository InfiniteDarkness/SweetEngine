# SweetEngine
A Game Engine in Rust

## Installing Rust
You can download Rust [here](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html). We recommend that you use nightlies until Rust is stable. 

## Building the project
Building the project is easy. Just clone the repo and run ``` cargo run ``` inside the project directory. There's no need to install the dependancies manually. Cargo takes care of that.
